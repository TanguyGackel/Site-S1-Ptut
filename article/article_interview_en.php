<article><h3>Presentation: </h3>
    <P> Hello I will introduce Mathieu He is a game designer and trainer. "In terms of training precisely,
        he carries out tutorials on his Youtube channels followed by 40,000 people now but also free training
        on the site http://creajv.com/ that he recently relaunched which soon has its 4000 registered learners
        and finally he also does training on the site http://tuto.com/ where he is a certified trainer.
        On the game side, he has created prototypes like Run Away (a horror game), Pirates (an RPG) and
        Everstopped (a runner, in collaboration with its MaxEstLa). </P>

<article><h3>Unreal Engine</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>Now he uses Unreal engine for many reasons, but these are the main ones:</p>
        <li>The blueprint that allows you to quickly create prototypes and even produce complete sets,
            accessible to all
        </li>
        <li>Its specialization and power on the real-time 3D rendering part.</li>
        <li>Its constant evolution with regular updates that always bring a lot of novelties.</li>
        <p>At the time of the interview he was using version 4.25.4 of Unreal Engine and about Unreal engine 5 which
            will be released soon. He is very interested in the new exceptional technologies with Nanite and Lumen.
            There will also be the new engine of Physics Chaos, improvements on audio and animation and
            he really looks forward to being able to create with it.</p>
    </ul>

<article><h3>My choice: </h3>
    <P> I chose Mathieu because I saw his videos which taught me a lot and was very well explained. It was
        so I was happy to go and ask him for an interview. Finally I would like to thank
        Mathieu who took his time to answer my questions. </P>
