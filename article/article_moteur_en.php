<article><h3>Introduction: </h3>
    <P> If unreal engine is one of the leaders in the market there is a whole range of video game design engine like
        Unity, Cryengine or even Gamemaker but then how to differentiate them and how to choose the one that will best suit your needs.
        will allow us to create our best games. For this we will see several different game engines and see some
        specialities of each one. </P>

<h2>The different game engines</h2>
<article><h3>Competitors of the march</h3>
    <p>To start with, you should know that there is no good universal choice, so we will see what to use this type of
        of games that one wishes, the most known engine in the market its unity and unreal engine that one can
        see in many AAA games like tekken or jedi stars wars, but with ubisoft for example we use
        its own game engine, which will be different, but if you want to use it as a hobby, the best thing to do is to
        start with unreal engine which is more often used and learned in school but if you want to make games
        mobile then unity is the best because it completely dominates the walk.</p>

    <article><h3>Different engines </h3>
        <P> now most of the game engines are free but some are paid like gameMaker Construg3 or
            pico 8 and it is sometimes difficult to find free equivalents. If you want more control and less
            there are other interesting frameworks to try like Monogame or Heaps but for more complex
            more guided choice and easier to handle a good example is Gamemaker which has an accessible language
            and a simple to use interface that has allowed to create games known as undertale. After there are
            the very specific engine that allows to create very specific games like RPG maker or ren py for
            make visual novels.</P>
